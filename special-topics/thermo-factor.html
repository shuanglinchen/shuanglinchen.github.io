[The First Order Derivative of Gibbs Energy w.r.t Molar Fraction]


Let \(G\) be the molar Gibbs energy of a \(c\)-component phase and \(\mu _k\) the chemical potential of component \(k\).

\begin{equation} 
G = G(x_1,x_2,\cdots,x_c)
\end{equation}

The chemical potential of the component \(k\), \(\mu _k\), is calculated by the following equation,

\begin{align}
\mu_k = G-\sum_{j=1}^{c} x_j \frac{\partial G}{\partial x_j} +\frac{\partial G}{\partial x_k}  \quad \quad \quad \quad (k=1,2,\cdots,c) \label {A2}
\end{align}

If the component \(c\) is taken as the dependent component, 

\begin{align}
x_c =1 - \sum_{j=1}^{c-1} x_j
\end{align}

then, the Gibbs energy is a function of \(c-1\) variables only,
\begin{equation} 
G = G(x_1,x_2,\cdots,x_{c-1})
\end{equation}

The chemical potential of the component \(k\), \(\mu _k\), is now calculated by these following equations,
\begin{align}
\mu_k = &G-\sum_{j=1}^{c-1} x_j \frac{\partial G}{\partial x_j} +\frac{\partial G}{\partial x_k}  \quad \quad \quad \quad (k=1,2,\cdots,c-1) \label {A5} \\
\mu_c = &G-\sum_{j=1}^{c-1} x_j \frac{\partial G}{\partial x_j} \label {A6}
\end{align}

Please note that \(\displaystyle \frac{\partial G}{\partial x_k}\) in Eq.\eqref{A5} and Eq.\eqref{A6} is different from that in Eq.\eqref{A2}.


Therefore, the first order derivative of \(G\) w.r.t molar fraction, \(x_j\), is given by
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial G}{\partial x_k} = \mu_k -  \mu_c \quad \quad \quad \quad (k=1,2,\cdots,c-1) \label {A7}
\end{align}


[Thermodynamic Factor]

Assume the Gibbs energy is a function of \(c-1\) independent composition variables,

\begin{equation} 
G = G(x_1,x_2,\cdots,x_{c-1})
\end{equation}


The second order derivatives of \(G\) w.r.t molar fraction can be calculated by

\begin{align}
\frac{\partial^2 G}{\partial x_j \partial x_k}= &\frac{\partial \mu_k}{\partial x_j} - \frac{\partial \mu_c}{\partial x_j}  \\ 
= &\frac{\partial \mu_j}{\partial x_k} - \frac{\partial \mu_c}{\partial x_k}\quad \quad \quad \quad (j, k=1,2,\cdots,c-1) 
\label {A8}
\end{align}

where the thermodynamic factor, \(\displaystyle \frac{\partial \mu_j}{\partial x_k}\), can be evaluated numerically by the finite difference method. Thermodynamic factors are available from PanEngine.
